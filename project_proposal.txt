ECE 511 Group Project Proposal
Lalita Bhaskaruni, Abhimanyu Chopra, Sammy Lin, and Nisarg Patel
1. Name and brief description of the project.
    Elderly Asset Distress Alarm System (EADAS) - This system will monitor a user's health information (heart rate, and
    vertical orientation).  When a distress is detected either by a fall or a spike in heart rate, an SMS notification is
    sent out to a preconfigured phone number with the details of the distress.

2. Describe the user interface and feedback that will be implemented.
    The user interface will be an LCD that will display the status of the system e.g., Normal, Alarm (fall, heart rate).
    An audio alert on the device will also be included.

3. List the peripherals you propose to use to implement for this project, describe the interface
that will be used to connect each to the microcontroller.
    Heart rate monitor - 
    Gyroscope/Accelerometer - SPI
    Cellular phone module - UART (AT commands)
    beeper - GPIO

4. Provide an estimated cost of the components you have identified to use in your project.
Estimate the total cost you expect the project to cost the group.
    MSP430FR6989 - $17
    Adafruit FONA GSM module - $49
    Antennas - $8
    Batteries - $16
    SIM card - $30
    Rough total - $172
5. Provide any additional details or concerns you want to share with the instructor for guidance
or recommendations.
    At the very least, we would like for the system to beep when a distress is detected.  We would like to implement to
    SMS messaging as a really nice to have.
